Trend Mining:
Frequency by year/topic/marks.
Recurrence intervals (time-series).
Emerging vs declining topics (weighted slope + recency decay).
Pattern clustering (multi-part composite question formation).

Memory Layer:
Maintain semantic embeddings + structured graph + provenance ledger.
Consolidate multi-pass reasoning into durable “TrendFrames.”
