modified, and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100

Consider the two-dimensional array A:
int  A[ ] [ ] = new int [8] [8 ];
where A [0] [0] is at location 8 in a paged memory system with pages of size 8. A small process that
manipulates the matrix resides in page 0 (location 0 to 7). Thus, every instruction fetch will be from
page 0. For three page frames, how many page faults are generated by the following array- 109 109 109 109 109

**Q6** A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation. Page tables for both
levels are stored in the main memory. Virtual and physical addresses are both 32 bits wide. The

109 memory is byte addressable. For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits 109 109 109 109 109

of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used
as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used
as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes
wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The
TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The
processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is
10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults

109 occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 109 109 109 109 109

ns).

**Q6** A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation. Page tables for both
levels are stored in the main memory. Virtual and physical addresses are both 32 bits wide. The

109 memory is byte addressable. For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits 109 109 109 109 109

of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used
as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used
as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes
wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The
TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The
processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is
10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults

109 occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 109 109 109 109 109

ns).

where A [0] [0] is at location 8 in a paged memory system with pages of size 8. A small process that

page 0. For three page frames, how many page faults are generated by the following array- 109 109 109 109 109

**Q6** A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation. Page tables for both
levels are stored in the main memory. Virtual and physical addresses are both 32 bits wide. The

109 memory is byte addressable. For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits 109 109 109 109 109

of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used
as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used
as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes
wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The
TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The
processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is
10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults

109 occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 109 109 109 109 109

ns).

**Q6** A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation. Page tables for both
levels are stored in the main memory. Virtual and physical addresses are both 32 bits wide. The

109 memory is byte addressable. For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits 109 109 109 109 109

of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used
as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used
as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes
wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The
TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The
processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is
10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults

109 occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 109 109 109 109 109

ns).

Disk request comes to the disk driver for cylinder 10, 22, 20, 2, 40, 6 and 38 in the same order. A
seek takes 6ms per cylinder move. How much seek time is needed, if following disk scheduling
algorithm is taken. In each case the disk head is parked at cylinder 20. 109 109 109 109
i) C-LOOK (initially moving towards last cylinder)
ii) Closest Cylinder Next



Assume, we have the workload as shown below. All 5 processes arrive at time 0, in the order given
below. The length of the CPU burst time is given in milliseconds

109 109 109 109 109

Process:   P1  P2  P3  P4  P5

Burst time: 10  29   3   7   12
Considering the FCFS, SJF and RR (q=10 ms) scheduling algorithms. Prepare the Gantt-chart and
find out which algorithm would give the minimum average turnaround time.



Assume we have a demand-paged memory. The page table is held in registers. It takes 8
milliseconds to service a page fault if an empty page is available or the replaced page is not
modified, and 20 milliseconds if the replaced page is modified. Memory access time is 100
nanoseconds. Assume that the page to be replaced is modified 70 percent of the time. What is the
maximum acceptable page-fault rate for an effective access time of no more than 200 nanoseconds?

**Q5** Define distributed system.List and explain the characteristics of distributed system?What are the
Advantages of Distributed Systems?Mention the challenges in distributed system.



**Q6** A processor uses 2-level page tables for virtual to physical address translation. Page tables for both
levels are stored in the main memory. Virtual and physical addresses are both 32 bits wide. The

109 memory is byte addressable. For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits 109 109 109 109 109

of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used
as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used
as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes
wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The
TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The
processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is
10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults

109 occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 109 109 109 109 109

ns).

For virtual to physical address translation, the 10 most significant bits of the virtual address are used as index into the first level page table while the next 10 bits are used as index into the second level page table. The 12 least significant bits of the virtual address are used as offset within the page. Assume that the page table entries in both levels of page tables are 4 bytes wide. Further, the processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB), with a hit rate of 96%. The TLB caches recently used virtual page numbers and the corresponding physical page numbers. The processor also has a physically addressed cache with a hit rate of 90%. Main memory access time is 10 ns, cache access time is 1 ns, and TLB access time is also 1 ns. Assuming that no page faults occur, compute the average time taken to access a virtual address approximately (to the nearest 0.5 ns).
